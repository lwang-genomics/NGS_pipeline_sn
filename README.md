# NGS_pipeline_sn: A Scalable and Reproducible Snakemake Workflow for RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq

**NGS_pipeline_sn** is a modular and fully automated Snakemake workflow designed for robust and reproducible analysis of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq data. Supporting both single-end and paired-end reads, the pipeline integrates standard NGS processing steps—including trimming, alignment, filtering, quantification, peak calling, and QC—while offering flexibility through a centralized config.yaml. With seamless scalability and transparent rule definitions, **NGS_pipeline_sn** is optimized for both local and high-performance computing environments.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

Download the pipeline to your local system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lwang-genomics/NGS_pipeline_sn.git
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Download default reference files  

This step provides genome index files for commonly used genomes (hg38, mm10) pre-formatted for this pipeline:
```bash
cd NGS_pipeline_sn
bash get_references.sh
```
*All reference genomes compatible with the workflow (e.g., STAR, Salmon, BWA indices) will be organized in the NGS_pipeline_sn/lib/ folder*

## I. RNA-Seq Processing Pipeline 

This Snakemake pipeline provides a modular and reproducible workflow for processing bulk RNA-seq data, supporting both traditional alignment-based quantification (STAR + featureCounts) and fast pseudo-alignment (Salmon). It automatically detects FASTQ files and processes them through quality control, optional adapter trimming, alignment or quantification, quantification QC, and visualization. Configuration is centralized via a config.yaml file for flexible, multi-sample analysis.


### Features

- Automatic detection of input FASTQ files (\*.R1.fq.gz, \*.R1.fastq, etc.)
- Supports both paired-end and single-end reads
- Optional read trimming with **Trimmomatic**
- Choice of traditional mapping with **STAR** or pseudo-alignment via **Salmon**
- Strand-specific quantification support
- Quality control via **FastQC** and **Qualimap**
- Generation of normalized BigWig files for visualization
- Integrated summary with **MultiQC**
- Configurable species genome choices
- Customizable via a single config.yaml file


### Usage

1. Place rna_seq.smk, config.yaml, and all sample FASTQ files into your working directory.


2. Edit config.yaml to suit your experiment:


3. Run Snakemake 
```
snakemake -s rna_seq.smk --cores 8
```
Optional: Run in background and log output:

```
snakemake -s rna_seq.smk --cores 8 > snakemake.log 2>&1 &
```


### Output Files
Depending on mode (pseudo: false or true), the pipeline generates:

#### STAR mode:
- {sample}_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam – Aligned BAM file
- {sample}_filtered_sorted.bam(.bai) – Filtered and indexed BAM
- {sample}_counts.txt – Gene-level counts from featureCounts
- {sample}.str1.bw, .str2.bw – Strand-specific bigWig tracks
- {sample}_qualimap/ – Qualimap QC folder
- multiqc_report.html – Summary report

#### Salmon mode:
- {sample}_salmon_output/ – Quantification results
- multiqc_report.html – Summary report
